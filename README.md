# PFN-job-application-tracker 📈

## 📌 About This Project

The idea for this app was born while I was applying to jobs on LinkedIn and jotting down basic information in a simple notepad.  
So I decided to build a proper application to track them:

- First to consolidate the **Python tools** I've recently learned.

- Second, to create something useful that anyone can clone and use to manage their own applications.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### 🖥️ Client

- **Next.js** (App Router) — React framework for SSR, ISR, and routing
- **React** + **TypeScript** — Component-based UI with static typing
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** — Form handling and schema validation
- **Redux Toolkit** (with **RTK Query**) — Global state management and API caching
- **Axios** — Configured as a reusable API client for RTK
- **Framer Motion** — Animations and transitions
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Sass** — Utility-first and custom styling

---

### 💾 Server

- **Python** `>=3.12, <4.0` — Main backend language
- **FastAPI** — Async API framework
- **SQLAlchemy** + **Alembic** — ORM with migration support
- **Pydantic** — Data parsing and validation
- **Mypy** — Static type checker
- **Poetry** — Dependency & project management
- **Gunicorn** + **Uvicorn** — ASGI server stack for development & production
- **Aiosmtplib** — Async email sending
- **Amazon S3** — Cloud file storage

---

### 🧪 Testing

- **Playwright** — End-to-end (E2E) testing for client
- **Vitest** — Unit testing for client
- **Pytest** — Unit testing for server
- **Postman** — API testing

---

### 🛠️ DevOps & Deployment

- **Turborepo** — Manages client and server in a monorepo architecture
- **Docker** — Containerization for local and production builds
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD automation
- **Fly.io** — Hosting and deployment platform
- **Zsh** — Custom scripts for scaffold boilerplate and development helpers

## 📦 Setup

After cloning the repository, start by installing dependencies:

```bash
yarn install && yarn install_pkg
```

This will initialize the project and install all required packages for both the client and server.

---

### 🔒 Environment Variables

All required environment variables are listed and validated inside:

```bash
apps/server/src/conf/env.py
```

This file uses **Pydantic** to:

- Define expected variables
- Enforce correct types
- Raise validation errors if anything is missing

This approach ensures that all variables needed by both client and server are defined in one central place — making your app easier to configure and maintain.

There’s no strict separation between client and server variables, but variables used by the client are easy to identify because **Next.js** requires them to start with **NEXT_PUBLIC**.

You can choose between two options:

1.  Full file reuse:
    Define all environment variables once (**server-side**), and copy the same .env file into the client folder.
    This is the easiest and safest approach.

2.  Split setup:
    Create a minimal .env file in the client folder, containing only the **NEXT_PUBLIC** variables.
    This reduces redundancy but requires you to manage two separate files.

---

### 🚀 Start App

To start a development session, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This uses **Turborepo** to run both the **Python server** and the **Next.js client** in parallel:

- 🐍 **Python** runs via **Uvicorn**, with **auto-reload** on **src** changes, at http://localhost:3000
- 🖥️ **Next.js** runs at http://localhost:3001

---

TO build the app run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This uses **Turborepo** to build both the client and server in parallel:

- 🐍 Python: Generates a .tar.gz and .whl (wheel) distribution packages.
  The wheel file is stored inside a custom **app_wheel** folder and used for **local** build.
- 🖥️ Next.js will follow his normal flow to generate **SSR** or **CSR** pages based on top page declaration and inner fetch logic.

---

Once the build is complete, you can run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This uses **Turborepo** to start both the **Python server** and the **Next.js client** in parallel:

- 🐍 **Python** runs via **Gunicorn**, using **8 workers**, available at http://localhost:3000

- 🖥️ **Next.js** is served at http://localhost:3001

---

### 🐋 Docker Setup

The following Docker helper scripts are designed to support **dynamic file locations**, making it easy to delete or adjust paths as needed depending on your project structure.

---

#### 🖥️ Build Client

To build the **client** Docker image, use:

```bash
dbc() {
  local dockerfile="Dockerfile.client"
  local context="."

  if [[ ! -f "$dockerfile" ]]; then
    dockerfile="apps/client/Dockerfile"
    context="apps/client"
  fi

  docker build \
    --no-cache \
    -f "$dockerfile" \
    -t app-client \
    --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=development \
    --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_BACK_URL_DEV=http://localhost:3000/api/v1 \
    --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_URL_DEV=http://localhost:3001 \
    "$context"
}

```

---

#### 💾 Build Server

To build the **server** Docker image, use:

```bash
dbs() {
  local dockerfile="Dockerfile.server"
  local context="."

  if [[ ! -f "$dockerfile" ]]; then
    dockerfile="apps/server/Dockerfile"
    context="apps/server"
  fi

  docker build \
    --no-cache \
    -f "$dockerfile" \
    -t app-server \
    "$context"
}

```

---

#### 🐳 Start Containers

To start a container for either the client or the server, use the following function:

```bash
dsi() {
  local port="${1:-1}"
  local name
  local env_p

  if [[ "$port" == "1" ]]; then
    name="client"
    env_p="apps/client/.env"
  elif [[ "$port" == "0" ]]; then
    name="server"
    env_p="apps/server/.env"
  else
    echo "❌ Unknown port '$port'. Use 1 (client) or 0 (server)"
    return 1
  fi

  local cname="app-${name}"

  docker rm -f "$cname" &>/dev/null || true

  docker run \
    --rm \
    --env-file "$env_p" \
    --name "$cname" \
    -p 300${port}:300${port} \
    "$cname"
}
```

---

To run both client and server containers in **parallel**:

```bash
dsi 0 & dsi 1
```

---

#### 🔗 Result

- 🖥️ **Next.js** is built into a Docker image and served from a container listening on http://localhost:3001
- 🐍 **Python** is packaged with Poetry, installs the .whl build, and runs from a container listening on http://localhost:3000/api/v1

---

### 🛡️ Reverse Proxy (optional)

As part of my local development setup, I prefer to start an `NGINX` server so the environment closely mirrors the production setup.

This allows me to:

- Test CORS issues directly in development
- Simulate deployment flow more realistically

---

💡 **Note:**

- You’ll need to configure **Node.js** to trust self-signed certs.

Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--use-system-ca"
```

---

For Self-signed certs I used `mkcert` and `nss`(optional for `Chrome` — required for `Firefox`).
Setup includes:

```bash
sudo pacman -S mkcert nss && \
mkcert -install && \
mkcert localhost
```

---

#### 📜 NGINX Config Script

💡 **Note:**

- Wherever you see `ninja` in paths (e.g. `/home/ninja/`), replace it with **your Linux username**, which you chose during OS installation.
  You can check your current username with:

```bash
echo $USER
```

---

```bash
# ❕ http is the default NGINX user on Manjaro (Arch-based distros).

user http;
worker_processes auto;

### ⚗️ Testing & Type Checking

#### ✒️ Type Checking & Formatting

- **Client**: Formatting with **ESLint** • Type checking with **TypeScript**
- **Server**: Formatting with **Ruff** • Type checking with **Mypy**

Run:

```bash
yarn check
```

- 💡 **Note**: **Ruff** is configured to allow ambiguous variables (**E741**).
  To disallow them, remove E741 from the ignore array in **tool.ruff.lint** in **pyproject.toml**

---

#### 🧪 Tests

##### 📜 Environment Variables

If you use **NGINX reverse proxies** and your dev URLs use **HTTPS**, both client and server need **test-specific URLs** for local and **CI/CD** testing.

The code is set to **prioritize test URLs** if they are present and **truthy**.  
To keep using your normal **HTTPS dev URLs** during development, comment out the test variables in **.env** so they are ignored.

**My workflow:**

- Keep test variables **commented** during normal development.
- **Uncomment** them only when running tests locally.
- Use **HTTP** for **CI/CD** pipelines.

---

##### 🔬 Test Flow

Running tests directly on a Next.js app can be slow and flaky due to rebuild times.

Instead:

1. **Build** the client

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Start** both client & server

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Run tests** on both client & server in parallel

   ```bash
   yarn tests
   ```

## ✏️ Final Notes

I hope you find the project interesting — if not, the app doesn’t come with a refund policy 💰

Thanks for checking out the repo ✌🏼
